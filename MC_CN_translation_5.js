Tots) 上校帶領平民組成反抗軍抵抗太空特戰隊的進攻，並成功將特戰隊打得落花流水，使其撤出新星地。隨即新星地殖民議會向地球聯邦大會正式宣示獨立，並將新星地重命名為獨立邦。\n\n 受到新星地事件的啟發，以及在地球聯邦暴政下的覺醒，附近星系的殖民地紛紛效法，很快地這些獨立殖民地促成了獨立國聯盟 (League of Independent States, 簡稱LIS) 的誕生 - 一個鬆散但擁有共同防禦條約對抗地球聯邦的組織。 \n\n 地球聯邦至今並不承認獨立國聯盟成員國的獨立地位，並視之為針對地球聯邦的叛匪。",

You can select units and buildings with a single click.  You can click/hold and then drag the mouse to select all units in an area.  Double clicking on a unit will select all units of that kind.  When a unit is selected, right clicking will execute an action, depending on what you right clicked on, whether it is a harvest order, a move order, or a build order.  The map is scrolled by click/dragging, or in fullscreen mode you can also simply move the mouse cursor to the edge of the screen to scroll the viewport.  The mouse scroll wheel allows for zooming in and out.\n\nThe engine also supports a variety of keyboard shortcuts, all of which can be customized in the Engine Settings menu.  Below is a reference of the currently available keyboard bindings:",

When using a gamepad, the UI will automatically transform to an optimized 'ten foot' interface, allowing for comfortable gameplay on a television or other large screen device.\n\nThe gamepad interface was designed around the Xbox 360/One controller layout, which has essentially become the standard gamepad layout for many PC and Android controllers.  The following controls are set with that layout in mind, although button names may differ depending on the brand and style of gamepad you are using:",

In Local Mode, you will start the game as a sub colony of one of the base AI civilizations, and will be required to pay the standard tax rates until you gain independence.  The AI will offer no extra assistance to you while building up your colony.\n\nLocal games are able to play LAN/Wifi based multiplayer with other local mode players on the same network.  LAN/Wifi multiplayer is cross platform and supported on all devices except when played through the web browser (for security reasons), unless the Ape Apps Desktop Bridge (a part of the Ape Apps Launcher) has been installed and activated.  LAN players are able to send each other messages and trade resources.\n\nUnless using a custom map or playing in creative mode, a local game can be switched into online mode, although doing so will cost the colony all of its resources.\n\nWhen in local mode, the games built in anti-cheating mechanisms are half way disabled.  A colony found to have cheated will not be punished in any way while playing a local game, but the game will block that colony from ever switching into online mode.",

            "manual-online-mode":       "Players with a valid Ape Apps Account and internet connection can play My Colony in Online Mode.  An online game is mostly similar to a local game, but there are several key differences.\n\nFirstly, starting a game in online mode will place your colony under the control of another players colony.  The player controlling the parent colony may choose to alter your tax rate higher or lower, or to charge no taxes at all.  Online parent colonies will also usually send their child colonies gifts of resources to help them get started.",

Once an online colony gains independence from it's parent, it is established as the leader of a new commonwealth, and any child colony that joins under the parent's charter becomes a member state of that commonwealth.  Players may choose to join any commonwealth they wish by the use of a charter code, which can be found in the statistics screen of the parent colony.  More information about charter codes and listings of the top online commonwealths can be found on https://www.my-colony.com\n\nThe benefits of joining any given commonwealth will vary widely based on the parent colony and the player who controls it.

Upon starting the game, you are able to select what size of map you wish to play on, as well as the abundance of starting resources on that map.  Later on in the game as your government level increases, you are able to expand your map size by annexing new lands.  The downfall of this is that game performance degrades as the size of your map increases, particularly on slower devices.  For this reason, the Region mode was created.",

            "manual-regions":           "Regional mode was added to the game due to performance issues related to ever expanding single city maps.  A region caps map sizes at either the small or medium level, and the ability to expand maps using the annexation feature has been removed.  The trade off to this limitation is the fact that a single region may contain up to 2,500 individual map files in total, theoretically allowing for massive colonies.\n\nRegions work by splitting a city up into smaller chunks, with each chuck being processed separately, yet sharing a common resource and technology pool.  This setup increases the performance of ultra large cities dramatically, and allows a city to be built in specialized chunks.  Economic and population statistics are available for both the individual cities and the region as a whole, but for online reporting purposes, the stats for the entire region are used.",

Therefore, in order to be easily readable, any visual tech tree would need to be manually created and updated by hand.  Such tech trees exist on the My Colony online reference website here: https://www.my-colony.com/reference/\n\nFor the purposes of this manual, all technologies are here listed in alphabetical order for easy lookup and reference, along with a description of each, their requirements, and what they may unlock.",
